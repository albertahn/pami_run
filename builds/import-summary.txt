ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

From Mad Horse Runner S1:
* .DS_Store
From unityads:
* .DS_Store
* AndroidManifest.xml
* build.xml
* proguard-project.txt
* res/
* res/drawable/
* res/drawable/unityads_background_button_pause.xml
* res/drawable/unityads_icon_play.xml
* res/drawable/unityads_icon_speaker_base.xml
* res/drawable/unityads_icon_speaker_triangle.xml
* res/drawable/unityads_icon_speaker_waves.xml
* res/layout/
* res/layout/unityads_button_audio_toggle.xml
* res/layout/unityads_button_pause.xml
* res/layout/unityads_view_video_paused.xml
* res/layout/unityads_view_video_play.xml
* res/values/
* res/values/strings.xml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In unityads:
* libs/unity-ads.jar => unityads/libs/unity-ads.jar
In Mad Horse Runner S1:
* AndroidManifest.xml => madHorseRunnerS1/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => madHorseRunnerS1/src/main/assets/
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libmain.so => madHorseRunnerS1/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libmain.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libmono.so => madHorseRunnerS1/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libmono.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libunity.so => madHorseRunnerS1/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libunity.so
* libs/unity-classes.jar => madHorseRunnerS1/libs/unity-classes.jar
* libs/x86/libmain.so => madHorseRunnerS1/src/main/jniLibs/x86/libmain.so
* libs/x86/libmono.so => madHorseRunnerS1/src/main/jniLibs/x86/libmono.so
* libs/x86/libunity.so => madHorseRunnerS1/src/main/jniLibs/x86/libunity.so
* res/ => madHorseRunnerS1/src/main/res/
* src/ => madHorseRunnerS1/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
